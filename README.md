## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How to use this application

1. clone this repo with the following command: `git clone https://github.com/Elaniobro/genus-to-species-keys.git`
1. install all the node modules with `pnpm install`


## üöß Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ pnpm install
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

## üîë API Key & Documentation:
TBD...


### üíª Code Commits

This application uses pre-commit checks and pre-push validation. This repo also follow [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) and [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) standards
To use the interactive commit tool, after you install the node modules you _should now_ be able to simply put: `cz` to create your commit message using the interactive menu.

### üëö Linting

This repo also has specific guidlines built into it, to help reduce the strain on code reviews. These rules are subject to change, but should ONLY be ammended through a pull request pending a code review. The files are also ran through a linter on `staged files` to verify that they adhere to the rules. You may run the command at anytime locally to check yourself.

```bash
pnpm lint:js       # checks */**[.js,.ts,.vue]
pnpm lint:prettier # checks .
pnpm lint:style    # checks */**[.vue,.css,.scss]
```

You may also check all 3 at once:

```bash
pnpm lint          # runs eslint, prettier and stylelint
```

If any of the linters returns an error, you may try to autofix running the following:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

## üß™ Testing

TBD

## ‚≠ê Best Practice

Please prefix all git branches with `



` for `Genus to Species Keys` and be succint in the branch description:

```bash
$ git branch
* main
$ git checkout -b mybranch-name
Switched to a new branch 'mybranch-name'
$ git branch
* mybranch-name
  main
```

use the imperative voice and try to keep the title commit under 50 characters. This can be done when saying to yourself, "this commit will: `your commit message here`."
_replace the code block in the quote with the commit message_

```bash
git commit -m "docs(readme):  add more sections"
```
